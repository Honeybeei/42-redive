# Redive in to 42 common core

## Introduction

This repository is a parallel universe of my original 42 common core projects, revisited and re-engineered with different technologies. The goal is to demonstrate versatility in programming and to improve upon the initial implementations.

> **‚ùó:** All the codes will be re-written from scratch, which means that norminette and some minor details will not be respected.

## Projects

### [libft](./libft/subject.md)

- **Description:** Implementation of basic functions for further use in other projects.

*...and so on for each project.*
