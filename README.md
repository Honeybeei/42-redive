# 42Redive

## Introduction

This repository is a parallel universe of my original 42 common core projects, revisited and re-engineered with different technologies. The goal is to demonstrate versatility in programming and to improve upon the initial implementations.

> **❗:** All the codes will be re-written from scratch, which means that norminette and some minor details will not be respected.

## Projects

   - **Description:** Implementation of basic functions for further use in other projects.
   - **Languages:** C/C++, Rust
   - **Link to original project:** [Original Project Link](subjects/libft.pdf)

*...and so on for each project.*
