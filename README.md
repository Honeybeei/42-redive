# 42Redive

## Introduction
This repository is a parallel universe of my original 42 common core projects, revisited and re-engineered with different technologies. The goal is to demonstrate versatility in programming and to improve upon the initial implementations.
!! All the codes will be re-written from scratch, which means that norminette and some minor details will not be respected.
