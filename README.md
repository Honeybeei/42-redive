# 42Redive

## Introduction

This repository is a parallel universe of my original 42 common core projects, revisited and re-engineered with different programming languages if possible. The goal is to demonstrate versatility in programming and to improve upon the initial implementations.

> **‚ùó:** All the codes will be re-written from scratch, which means that norminette and some minor details will not be respected.
